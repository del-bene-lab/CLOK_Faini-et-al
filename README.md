# Halotag-CLOK

This repository contains part of the code, data, and protocols associated with the CLOK paper  
(**Faini et al.**, https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-7039578/v1).  
The content provided here includes analysis code and exemplary datasets primarily related to visual responses in the larval optic tectum and to combining the CLOK method with multiple constructs.

## 📁 Repository Contents
### **DATA folder**
- CSV files summarizing neuronal properties derived from fluorescent labeling  
  (position, multi-dye intensities, dye ratios, etc.)
- Exemplary calcium traces recorded during visual stimulation from both PVN tectal neurons and SINs  
  (related to **Fig. 4**) and of calcium and voltage traces related to Fig. 6a–b.
---
### **CODE folder**
- Exemplary Python notebooks to perform: - single-neuron calcium activity analysis; - correlation between functional responses and birthdate labeling. 
- MATLAB scripts used to process Whalocamp and Voltron recordings   (related to Fig. 6a–b).
---
### **IMAGE EXAMPLE folder**
- Representative raw multicolor fluorescence images (different JF-dyes and GCaMP emission)
- Corresponding ROIs used in experiments investigating birthdate-resolved visual responses

A more detailed description is available within each subfolder.
